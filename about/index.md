title: About

I was Born and raised in Gujarat, India. I pursued Bachelors of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee which is one of the premier Engineering Institutions of the country.

I got a Masters degree in Engineering Management from University of California Irvine with academic focus on Statistics and Business Intelligence. After graduating from UC Irvine in June 2016, I started working at Panasonic Avionics Corporation (PAC) - IT division as Production Support Analyst. My major task was supporting company's internal end users by providing System & Data Integration for Product Lifecycle Management tool - Oracle Agile PLM.

Starting August 2017, my Current position is as a Data Analyst in Global Communication Services (GCS) at PAC. In my current role, I work with Account Management Team focused on improving Business with the Customers. My task is leveraging the Passenger Consumption data and Flight Performance data to improve Customer Intelligence via Reporting and Analytics.

I primarily use Python and Excel to perform Analytics and reporting tasks. I believe these tools complement each other really well. Excel is good for reporting, improving aesthetics and a robust tool used by all employees. Python is quite handy in performing automation for redundant tasks and for complex calculations which otherwise would be difficult to perform using Excel. I love performing Data Mining and Analytics on complex Data and the challenges it brings. Besides Excel and Python, I also have good SQL skills. I use them sometimes to extract raw data from the company database server.

Outside of work, I have been using Python for my Independent Data Science Projects which are mainly based on Kaggle. The project based learning has improved my skills and knowledge immensely. I find the Data Science field quite fascinating & I wish to learn it  more deeply and implement the gained knowledge/skills at my work.
